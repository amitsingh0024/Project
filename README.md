```

## Usage

### Testing the Model

1. Place your test image in the `data/test` directory.

2. Run the visualization script:
```bash
python tests/test_visualization.py
```

This will:
- Load your test image
- Process it through the model
- Generate a high-resolution output
- Display input and output images side by side
- Calculate and display PSNR and SSIM metrics
- Save the comparison image in the `test_outputs` directory

### Understanding the Output

The script generates:
- A side-by-side comparison of input and output images
- PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) value in dB
- SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) value between 0 and 1

Higher PSNR and SSIM values indicate better quality:
- PSNR > 30 dB is generally considered good
- SSIM closer to 1 indicates better structural similarity

## Model Details

The model uses a custom generator architecture based on deep learning techniques for image super-resolution. It's trained to enhance image resolution while preserving important details and reducing artifacts.

### 1. **High-Level Model Design Overview**

The model we're designing is a **GAN-based super-resolution model** that combines the strengths of **Swin Transformers** for feature extraction with a **custom generator** inspired by Real-ESRGAN's RRDB blocks, but adapted to refine and upscale the feature map produced by the Swin Transformer. Here's a high-level structure:

```plaintext
Input (Low-Resolution Image)
       |
       v
Swin Transformer Feature Extractor
       |
       v
Feature Map Output (rich in global and local context)
       |
       v
Custom Generator (refinement and upsampling) -> High-Resolution Image
       |
       v
Discriminator (adversarial training)
```

**Purpose**:
- The **Swin Transformer** captures long-range dependencies and global structure, providing a powerful feature map.
- The **custom generator** refines and upscales this feature map into a high-resolution image.
- The **discriminator** evaluates the realism of the generated high-resolution image, helping the generator produce more realistic outputs.

---

### 2. **Detailed Component Breakdown**

Let's dive into each part of the model in more detail.

#### a) **Swin Transformer Feature Extractor**

- **Input**: Low-resolution image (e.g., 64x64x3 for a 4x upscale target of 256x256).
- **Process**: The image is split into non-overlapping patches, each treated as a token, which are then processed through **window-based self-attention** and **shifted window operations**. This captures both local detail and global structure.
- **Output**: A feature map (e.g., 16x16x128) where each "pixel" or spatial position contains a 128-dimensional feature vector representing rich context for that region.

**Mathematics and Notation**:
- Let \( I_{LR} \) be the low-resolution input image.
- Swin Transformer processes \( I_{LR} \) as:
  \[
  F_{swin} = \text{SwinTransformer}(I_{LR})
  \]
  where \( F_{swin} \) is the feature map output, capturing hierarchical, contextual information.

#### b) **Custom Generator**

The generator is specifically designed to refine and upscale \( F_{swin} \) into a high-resolution output.

- **Input**: The Swin Transformer feature map \( F_{swin} \).
- **Processing**:
  1. **Refinement Blocks**: Inspired by RRDB blocks, but simplified to focus on enhancing details and preserving important features without dense connections. This includes lightweight convolutions and residual connections for detail refinement.
  2. **Upsampling Layers**: These layers (e.g., pixel shuffle or transposed convolution) upscale the feature map to the target resolution.
- **Output**: A high-resolution image \( I_{HR} \).

**Mathematics and Notation**:
- Let \( G \) represent the generator. It transforms \( F_{swin} \) into the high-resolution output:
  \[
  I_{HR} = G(F_{swin})
  \]

#### c) **Discriminator**

The discriminator helps the generator by providing feedback on the realism of the generated images.

- **Input**: Both the real high-resolution image and the generated high-resolution image.
- **Processing**: The discriminator classifies images as real or fake by processing the entire image or patches of the image, capturing local textures and details.
- **Output**: A probability score indicating whether the image is real (1) or fake (0).

### 3. **Loss Functions**

To train this model, we use a combination of losses:

#### a) **Pixel Loss** (L1 or L2 Loss)
   - Used to ensure pixel-level similarity between generated images and real images.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     \mathcal{L}_{\text{pixel}} = \| I_{HR} - I_{real} \|_1 \quad \text{or} \quad \| I_{HR} - I_{real} \|_2^2
     \]
   where \( I_{HR} \) is the generated high-resolution image, and \( I_{real} \) is the real high-resolution image.

#### b) **Perceptual Loss** (Feature Loss)
   - Computes similarity between feature representations from a pre-trained network (e.g., VGG) for \( I_{HR} \) and \( I_{real} \), focusing on perceptual similarity.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     \mathcal{L}_{\text{perc}} = \| \phi(I_{HR}) - \phi(I_{real}) \|_2^2
     \]
   where \( \phi \) denotes features extracted by the pre-trained network.

#### c) **Adversarial Loss** (GAN Loss)
   - The generator aims to minimize this loss to "fool" the discriminator, while the discriminator tries to maximize it to correctly classify real and fake images.
   - **Generator Adversarial Loss**:
     \[
     \mathcal{L}_{\text{GAN}}^{\text{gen}} = -\log(D(I_{HR}))
     \]
   - **Discriminator Loss**:
     \[
     \mathcal{L}_{\text{GAN}}^{\text{disc}} = -\left[ \log(D(I_{real})) + \log(1 - D(I_{HR})) \right]
     \]

#### d) **Total Loss for Generator**:
   - The generator minimizes a weighted combination of these losses:
     \[
     \mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \alpha \mathcal{L}_{\text{pixel}} + \beta \mathcal{L}_{\text{perc}} + \gamma \mathcal{L}_{\text{GAN}}^{\text{gen}}
     \]
   where \( \alpha \), \( \beta \), and \( \gamma \) are weights that control the contribution of each loss.

### 4. **Weights Initialization and Training Strategy**

#### a) **Weights Initialization**
   - **Swin Transformer**: Initialize with pre-trained weights if available, or use Xavier or He initialization.
   - **Generator and Discriminator**: Use He initialization for convolutional layers to help with convergence.

#### b) **Training Strategy**
   - **Adversarial Training**: Train the generator and discriminator in alternating steps. For each generator update, run one or more discriminator updates.
   - **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Use a learning rate scheduler (e.g., cosine annealing or step decay) to progressively reduce the learning rate and stabilize training.
   - **Gradient Clipping**: Apply gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients, which can occur in GAN training.
